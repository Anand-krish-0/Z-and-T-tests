Z test: 
    Z-test is a statistical test that is used to determine whether the mean of a sample is significantly 
    different from a known population mean when the population standard deviation is known. 
    It is particularly useful when the sample size is large (>30).

    Z-test can also be defined as a statistical method that is used to determine whether the distribution of 
    the test statistics can be approximated using the normal distribution or not. It is the method to 
    determine whether two sample means are approximately the same or different when their variance is 
    known and the sample size is large (should be >= 30).

    A z test is conducted on a population that follows a normal distribution with independent data 
    points and has a sample size that is greater than or equal to 30. It is used to check whether 
    the means of two populations are equal to each other when the population variance is known. 
    The null hypothesis of a z test can be rejected if the z test statistic is statistically significant 
    when compared with the critical value.

Assumptions of z-test:
    1. The sample size should be greater than 30. Otherwise, we should use the t-test.
    2. Samples should be drawn at random from the population.
    3. The standard deviation of the population should be known.
    4. Samples that are drawn from the population should be independent of each other.
    5. The data should be normally distributed.

Steps to perform Z-test:

    1. First, identify the null and alternate hypotheses.
    2. Determine the level of significance (∝).
    3. Find the critical value of z in the z-test using
    4. Calculate the z-test statistics. 
    Below is the formula for calculating the z-test statistics.

Z = (sample mean - μ)/(σ / sqrt of(n))

where, 
    μ : mean of the population.
    σ : Standard deviation of the population.
    n: sample size.
Now compare with the hypothesis and decide whether to reject or not reject the null hypothesis. 

Types of z-test:
    1. One tailed z_test.
        a.Rigth tailed test.
        b.Left tailed test.
    2. Two tailed z-test.
    
1. One tailed z-test:
    A one-sample z test is used to check if there is a difference between the sample mean and 
    the population mean when the population standard deviation is known. The formula for the z test 
    statistic is given as follows:
Z = (sample mean - μ) / (σ / sqrt of(n))
 
μ : is the population mean. 
σ : is the population standard deviation.
n : is the sample size.

a. Right tailed z-test.
    In this test, our region of rejection is located to the extreme right of the distribution. 
b. Left tailed z-test:
    In this test, our region of rejection is located to the extreme left of the distribution.

2. Two tailed z-test:
    In this test, we have provided 2 normally distributed and independent populations, and 
    we have drawn samples at random from both populations. Here, we consider u1 and u2 to be 
    the population mean, and X1 and X2 to be the observed sample mean. Here, our null hypothesis 
    could be like this:

Null hypothesis H_0 : μ_1 - μ_2 = 0

Alternative hypothesis H_1 : μ_1 - μ_2 != 0

and the formula for calculating the z-test score:

Z = ((mean of x_1 - mean of x_2) - (μ_1 - μ_2)) / sqrt of(((σ_1)^2 / n_1) + ((σ_2)^2) / n_2)

where ​
σ_1 and σ_2 : are the standard deviation. 
n_1 and n_2 : are the sample size of population mean corresponding to μ_1 - μ_2.
