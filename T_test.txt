T-Test:
    
    A t-test is a type of inferential statistic test used to determine if there is a significant 
    difference between the means of two groups. It is often used when data is normally distributed 
    and population variance is unknown.

    The t-test is used in hypothesis testing to assess whether the observed difference between 
    the means of the two groups is statistically significant or just due to random variation.

    t-test is a statistical significant test for hypothesis testing.
    t_test follows students_t distribution.

    There are 3 steps in Hypothesis Testing:

    1. State Null and Alternate Hypothesis
    2. Perform Statistical Test
    3. Accept and reject the Null Hypothesis
    In this article, we will discuss the t-test.
    
    Assumptions in T-test:
     1. Independence: The observations within each group must be independent of each other.
     2. Normality: The data within each group should be approximately normally distributed.
     3. Homogeneity of Variances (for independent samples t-test): The variances of 
        the two groups being compared should be equal.
     4. Population parameter (mean and standard deviation) is not known.
     5. Small sample: Sample size (number of observations) < 30.

Types of t-test:
    1. One-sample t-test : The mean of a single group against a known mean.

    2. Independent (Two-sample) t-test : The mean of a single group against a known mean.

    3. Paired t-test : Compares means from the same group at different times.

One sample T-test
    One sample t-test is one of the widely used t-tests for comparison of the sample mean of 
    the data to a particularly given value. Used for comparing the sample mean to the true/population mean.

    We can use this when the sample size is small. (under 30) data is collected randomly and 
    it is approximately normally distributed. It can be calculated as:

t = (sample mean - population mean)/(sample standard deviation/sample size)     

where,

    t = t-value
    x_bar = sample mean
    μ = true/population mean
    σ = standard deviation
    n = sample size

Two sample test:(independent sample test)
    An Independent sample t-test, commonly known as an unpaired sample t-test is used to find out 
    if the differences found between two groups is actually significant or just a random occurrence. 

We can use this when:

    the population mean or standard deviation is unknown. (information about the population is unknown)
    the two samples are separate/independent. For eg. boys and girls (the two are independent of each other)
It can be calculated using:

test statisic:

t = (mean of x_1 - mean of x_2)/sqrt of((s_1^2/n_1) + (s_2^2/n_2))    

Where,
    mean of x_1 and mean of x_2 = are the means of two groups. 
    s_1 and s_2 = are standard deviation of two gruops.
    n_1 and n_2 = are the sample size of two groups.

Paired Two-sample T-test:
    Paired sample t-test, commonly known as dependent sample t-test is used to find out 
    if the difference in the mean of two samples is 0. The test is done on dependent samples, 
    usually focusing on a particular group of people or things. In this, each entity is measured 
    twice, resulting in a pair of observations. 

We can use this when:

    Two similar (twin like) samples are given. [Eg, Scores obtained in English and Math (both subjects)]
    The dependent variable (data) is continuous.
    The observations are independent of one another.
    The dependent variable is approximately normally distributed.
It can be calculated using,

test statistic: 

t = (d^bar)/(s_d/sqrt of(n))
    
where,

d^bar = is the mean of the differences between the paired observations.
(s_d) = is the standard deviation of the differences.
(n) = is the number of paired observations.
