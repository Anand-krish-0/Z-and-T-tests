A.  One tailed test:
    A one-tailed test may be either left-tailed or right-tailed.

    A left-tailed test is used when the alternative hypothesis states that the true value of 
    the parameter specified in the null hypothesis is less than the null hypothesis claims.

    A right-tailed test is used when the alternative hypothesis states that the true value of 
    the parameter specified in the null hypothesis is greater than the null hypothesis claims

1. Statistical hypothesis test, where the alternate hypothesis is one-side (either right or left side).
2. Hypothesis : Directional
3. Level of Significance : Entire level of significance lies on one side.	
4. Region of Rejection : Either on the left side  or right side of the sampling distribution
5. Sign in alternate hypothesis : '<' (or) '>'

B. Two tailed test:
    two-tailed tests will have two critical regions. If we require a 100(1-α)% confidence interval 
    we have to make some adjustments when using a two-tailed test.
    
    The confidence interval must remain a constant size, so if we are performing a two-tailed test, 
    as there are twice as many critical regions then these critical regions must be half the size. 
    
    This means that when we read the tables, when performing a two-tailed test, we need to consider α/2
    rather than α.

1. Statistical hypothesis test, where the alternate hypothesis is two-tailed.
2. Hypothesis : Non-Directional
3. Level of Significance : Splits the level of significance into half.
4. Region of Rejection : The rejection region is from both sides.
5. Sign in alternate hypothesis : '=' (or) '!=' (not equal)
